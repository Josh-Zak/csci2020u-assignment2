A) This project creates a server that can be used for file sharing.
Clients can connect to the server and either upload a file from a local
directory or download a file from the server directory to their local
directory.

C)  1. Make sure the server is running.
    2. Run the client which will automatically connect to the server
        (make sure you pass the port number (16789), the server address
        (localhost) and the directory of your choosing).
    3. Select the file you wish to upload/download form the UI and hit
        upload/download. The file will automatically be uploaded/downloaded
        to the selected folder/server.
